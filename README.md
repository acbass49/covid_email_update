# covid_email_update
sends a saturday covid email update to everyone on a google survey spreadsheet. Blog post written up about this [here](https://alexbass.me/projects/weekly-covid-update/). I originally wrote this for myself to stay up to date on US covid trends data, but thought others may benefit if interested. Click the link above to navigate to the page where you subcribe to a weekly covid email update.

### Cool features...
1. Sends a weekly email to subscribers with 3 figures for user's state and 3 figures nationally (total 6): total cases, total deaths, vaccination rate.
2. User can personalize their data according to the state they live in.
3. No ads.

### Under the hood...
The google survey from [here](https://alexbass.me/projects/weekly-covid-update/) contains emails of subscribers and is connected to a google sheet. This repository reads that google sheet (using an encrypted token from a google service account), runs an analysis script in R that CDC wrangles data and creates a few figures, then sends an email to subscribers. This is (obviously, since you are reading this) a public repository which contains encrypted tokens, but no visible personal information, so feel free to browse.

Email looks like image below (but updated to the current time) ðŸ‘‡
